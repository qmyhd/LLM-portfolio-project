# Archived Migrations (000-059)

These migration files have all been applied to production and are **frozen**.
They are kept here for historical reference only.

The current schema is captured in `../060_baseline_current.sql`.
All new changes go in `../06N_*.sql` files.

**Do NOT edit these files.** The migration ledger treats them as immutable.
